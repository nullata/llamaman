A browser-based UI for launching, monitoring, and managing multiple [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) server instances. LlamaMan runs as a lightweight Python container and spawns llama-server as sibling Docker containers using the official llama.cpp images. Includes an Ollama-compatible API proxy so it works as a drop-in replacement for Ollama with [Open WebUI](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui).

## Features

- **Model library** - scans `/models` for GGUF files, shows quant type and file size
- **One-click launch** - configure GPU layers, context size, threads, multi-GPU, extra args
- **Preset configs** - save/load per-model launch settings
- **Download manager** - pull models from HuggingFace with speed throttling and auto-retry on failure
- **Model backup and restore** - export all model metadata and presets to JSON, restore on any instance by re-queuing missing downloads automatically
- **Instance management** - stop, restart, remove, view live-streamed logs
- **GPU VRAM indicator** - per-GPU VRAM and utilization, queried natively (no running instance required)
- **Container resource monitoring** - live CPU%, core quota, RAM usage, and GPU assignment per running instance card
- **Idle timeout** - auto-sleep instances after configurable idle period, wake on next request
- **Ollama-compatible proxy** - OpenWebUI discovers models and auto-starts servers on demand
- **Authentication** - user accounts with session login, API key management with bearer tokens
- **Require auth toggle** - enforce bearer token authentication on all endpoints (including model loading) or leave model endpoints open
- **Persistent state** - instance history and configs survive container restarts
- **Storage backends** - JSON files (default) or MariaDB/MySQL via SQLAlchemy
- **Proxy sampling overrides** - force temperature, top-k, top-p, presence penalty, and repeat penalty on all proxied requests, configurable per model preset
- **Docker image management** - pull any llama.cpp image by name, delete old local images from the Settings UI

## What's New

- **Universal GPU support** - single `Dockerfile` and image for NVIDIA, AMD (ROCm), Intel Arc, and CPU. GPU vendor is auto-detected at startup; `GPU_TYPE` overrides if needed. `LLAMA_IMAGE` is also auto-selected from the detected vendor.
- **Native GPU monitoring** - VRAM and utilization are queried inside the llamaman container directly (pynvml for NVIDIA, `/sys/class/drm` sysfs for AMD/Intel Arc), so the GPU panel works without a running llama-server instance.
- **Container resource monitoring** - each running instance card shows live CPU%, core quota, RAM used/limit, and GPU assignment, updated every 3 seconds via a separate poll.
- **Docker image management** - pull any llama.cpp image by name, delete old local images, all from the Settings UI.
- **Model backup and restore** - export all model metadata and presets to JSON; restore on any instance with downloads queued automatically for missing models.
- **Repeat penalty in proxy sampling overrides** - configurable per preset, default 0 (disabled).
- **CPU quota + memory limit** - setting CPU Threads now also applies a Docker `nano_cpus` quota; a new Memory Limit field caps container RAM.

## How It Works

LlamaMan is a lightweight Python web app with no dependency on llama.cpp itself. When you launch a model, LlamaMan uses the Docker socket to spawn a `ghcr.io/ggml-org/llama.cpp:server-*` container as a sibling on the host. GPU passthrough, port binding, and volume mounts are configured per-container via the Docker SDK.

```
Host machine
├── Docker daemon
│   ├── llamaman container        (Python only - no GPU usage - only monitoring, no llama.cpp)
│   │   └── /var/run/docker.sock  (talks to Docker daemon)
│   ├── llamaman-<id> container   (llama.cpp:server-cuda, GPU attached)
│   └── llamaman-<id> container   (llama.cpp:server-cuda, GPU attached)
└── GPU hardware
```

**To update llama.cpp** - no llamaman rebuild needed:
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/ggml-org/llama.cpp:server-cuda
```

## Requirements

- Docker with access to `/var/run/docker.sock`
- **One** of:
  - [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html) for NVIDIA GPUs
  - [ROCm-compatible setup](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/) for AMD GPUs
  - Intel Arc with `/dev/dri` access for Intel GPUs
- The matching llama.cpp server image pulled on the host (see Quick Start)

## Quick Start

Before starting, edit `docker-compose.yml` and set the two host path variables to match your volume mount sources:

```yaml
- HOST_MODELS_DIR=/absolute/host/path/to/models
- HOST_LOGS_DIR=/absolute/host/path/to/logs
```

These must be the real paths on the Docker host. LlamaMan passes them to the Docker daemon when spawning sibling llama-server containers, so they must resolve on the host - not inside the llamaman container.

**NVIDIA:**
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/ggml-org/llama.cpp:server-cuda
docker compose up --build
```

For native VRAM monitoring, also uncomment the `deploy.resources.reservations` block in `docker-compose.yml`.

**AMD (ROCm):**
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/ggml-org/llama.cpp:server-rocm
# Edit docker-compose.yml: set LLAMA_IMAGE=ghcr.io/ggml-org/llama.cpp:server-rocm
docker compose up --build
```

**Intel Arc:**
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/ggml-org/llama.cpp:server-sycl
# Edit docker-compose.yml: set LLAMA_IMAGE=ghcr.io/ggml-org/llama.cpp:server-sycl
docker compose up --build
```

**CPU only:**
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/ggml-org/llama.cpp:server
# Edit docker-compose.yml: set LLAMA_IMAGE=ghcr.io/ggml-org/llama.cpp:server
docker compose up --build
```

- **Management UI**: http://localhost:5000
- **Llamaman proxy** (Ollama-compatible API): http://localhost:42069
- **llama-server public instance ports**: 8000-8020

On first launch, visit the UI to create an admin account via `/setup`.

> **Note:** LlamaMan needs access to the Docker socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`) to spawn llama-server containers. This is already configured in `docker-compose.yml`. Be aware of the security implications - a container with Docker socket access has the ability to manage other containers on the host.

## Authentication

LlamaMan has a built-in auth system with two layers:

### User accounts (session-based)

On first launch, `/setup` lets you create an admin account. After that, all browser access requires login. Session cookies authenticate UI requests.

### API keys (bearer tokens)

Create API keys in the **API Keys** section of the UI. External clients (OpenWebUI, scripts, etc.) authenticate with:

```
Authorization: Bearer llm-xxxxxxxxxx
```

### Require authentication toggle

The **"Require authentication for all endpoints"** toggle (on by default) controls whether model-serving endpoints require a bearer token:

| Toggle | Model endpoints (`/api/chat`, `/v1/chat/completions`, etc.) | Management endpoints (`/api/instances`, etc.) | Per-instance proxy ports |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| **ON** (default) | Bearer token required | Bearer token or session required | Bearer token required |
| **OFF** | Open (no auth) | Bearer token or session required | Open (no auth) |

When the toggle is **ON**, all three port surfaces are protected:
- **Port 5000** (management UI + API) - Flask `before_request` hook
- **Port 42069** (Ollama-compatible proxy) - same Flask app, same hook
- **Ports 8000-8020** (per-instance proxies) - WSGI-level auth check

### OpenWebUI with authentication

When `require_auth` is on, configure OpenWebUI to send a valid API key:

```yaml
open-webui:
  environment:
    - OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://llamaman:42069
    - OPENAI_API_BASE_URLS=http://llamaman:42069/v1
    - OPENAI_API_KEYS=llm-your-api-key-here
```

## Models

Place models inside the `models/` volume:

- **GGUF files**: any `.gguf` file (recommended - llama.cpp native format)
- **HuggingFace repos**: directories containing `config.json`

Or use the **Download** button in the UI to pull from HuggingFace.

## Launching Instances

1. Select a model from the sidebar
2. Configure launch settings (GPU layers, context size, idle timeout, etc.)
3. Click **Launch** - LlamaMan spawns a llama-server container and the instance appears with a status badge
4. Optionally click **Save Preset** to remember settings for that model

Each instance exposes an OpenAI-compatible API on its assigned port.

### Layer autodetection

When you select a GGUF model, LlamaMan reads the file's metadata to detect the total number of layers (block count). This is displayed next to the **GPU Layers** input so you can see exactly how many layers are available to offload (e.g. `/ 32`). Set GPU Layers to `-1` to offload all layers to GPU.

### Launch settings reference

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **GPU Layers** | `-1` | Number of layers to offload to GPU. `-1` = all layers, `0` = CPU only. Total layers are autodetected from the GGUF file. |
| **Context Size** | `4096` | Maximum context window in tokens (`--ctx-size`). |
| **Parallel** | `1` | Number of parallel sequences the llama-server can process simultaneously (`--parallel`). Controls KV cache slot allocation inside the server itself. |
| **Idle Timeout min** | `0` | Minutes of inactivity before the server is stopped to free VRAM. `0` = disabled. See [Idle Timeout](#idle-timeout). |
| **Max Concurrent** | `0` | Maximum number of inference requests allowed in-flight at once. `0` = unlimited. When set, incoming requests are queued and gated by a semaphore. |
| **Max Queue Depth** | `200` | Maximum number of requests that can wait in the queue when `Max Concurrent` is active. Requests beyond this limit are rejected with HTTP 429. |
| **Share Queue** | off | When enabled, multiple proxy-managed instances of the **same model** share a single request queue. Incoming requests are distributed across instances as slots become available, providing simple load balancing. |
| **Embedding Model** | off | Marks the instance as an embedding model. Embedding instances are **excluded** from the `LLAMAMAN_MAX_MODELS` count and will never be evicted by the proxy's LRU policy. |
| **CPU Threads** | _(auto)_ | Sets both `--threads N` for llama-server and the container's CPU quota (`--cpus N`). Leave blank to let the container and llama-server use all available cores. |
| **Memory Limit** | _(none)_ | Hard memory cap for the llama-server container (e.g. `32g`, `8192m`). Equivalent to `deploy.resources.limits.memory` in Docker Compose. Leave blank for no limit. |
| **GPU Devices** | _(global default)_ | Comma-separated GPU indices to make visible to this container (e.g. `0,1`). Overrides `LLAMA_GPU_DEVICES` for this instance. Leave blank to use the global default. Not supported on Intel Arc. |
| **Extra Args** | _(empty)_ | Additional flags passed directly to llama-server (e.g. `--flash-attn`). |
| **Proxy Sampling Overrides** | off | When enabled, the proxy forces the configured sampling parameters on every request forwarded to this instance, regardless of what the client sends. |
| **Temperature** | `0.8` | Sampling temperature to enforce (range: `0.0`–`2.0`). Only active when proxy sampling overrides are enabled. |
| **Top K** | `40` | Top-k sampling value to enforce (min: `0`). Only active when proxy sampling overrides are enabled. |
| **Top P** | `0.95` | Top-p (nucleus) sampling value to enforce (range: `0.01`–`1.0`). Only active when proxy sampling overrides are enabled. |
| **Presence Penalty** | `0.0` | Presence penalty to enforce (range: `-2.0`–`2.0`). Only active when proxy sampling overrides are enabled. |
| **Repeat Penalty** | `0.0` | Repeat penalty to enforce (range: `0.0`–`2.0`). `0` = disabled (not injected). Only active when proxy sampling overrides are enabled. |

### Concurrency and queueing

When **Max Concurrent** is set to a value greater than 0, LlamaMan places a concurrency gate in front of the instance. Requests that exceed the limit are held in a FIFO queue (up to **Max Queue Depth**). If the queue is also full, new requests are rejected with HTTP 429.

The gate tracks active and queued request counts, which are visible in the instance list via the API.

**Parallel vs Max Concurrent:** `Parallel` controls how many sequences the llama-server processes internally (KV cache slots). `Max Concurrent` is an external gate that limits how many requests LlamaMan forwards to the server at once. You can use both together - for example, `Parallel=4` with `Max Concurrent=4` ensures the server always has enough KV slots for the requests it receives.

## GPU Stats

LlamaMan queries GPU VRAM and utilization natively - no running llama-server instance required.

| Vendor | Method | Requirement |
|---|---|---|
| NVIDIA | `pynvml` (NVML library direct) | Uncomment the `deploy.resources.reservations` block in `docker-compose.yml` to grant the llamaman container NVIDIA toolkit `utility` capability |
| AMD | `/sys/class/drm` sysfs | `/sys/class/drm:ro` volume mount (included in `docker-compose.yml` by default) |
| Intel Arc | `/sys/class/drm` sysfs | Same mount as AMD |

When native access is not configured, LlamaMan falls back to exec-ing `nvidia-smi` / `rocm-smi` inside a running llama-server container (previous behavior). Stats always reflect the full host GPU state, not just a single container's usage.

## Idle Timeout

Set **Idle Timeout min** in the launch form (0 = disabled). When enabled:

- The manager proxies the instance port (transparent to clients)
- After N minutes of no requests, the llama-server container is stopped to free VRAM
- On the next request, a new container is spawned with the same config
- Client sees the same port/API with just a cold-start delay

For instances managed by the llamaman proxy (OpenWebUI), use the `LLAMAMAN_IDLE_TIMEOUT` env var instead.

## Per-Instance Proxy

When any of the following are enabled for an instance, LlamaMan inserts a WSGI proxy in front of the llama-server container on that port: **Idle Timeout**, **Max Concurrent**, or **Proxy Sampling Overrides**. The public port (e.g. 8000) is handled by the proxy; the llama-server container listens internally on a separate port.

### Model name validation

The proxy enforces that requests reach the correct model. On inference endpoints (`/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/completions`, `/v1/embeddings`, `/completion`, `/chat/completions`):

- If the request body includes a `"model"` field, the proxy compares it against the loaded model's filename stem (lowercased, without extension). A **prefix match is accepted** - e.g. `"qwen2.5-0.5b-instruct-q2"` matches `"qwen2.5-0.5b-instruct-q2_k"`. A mismatch returns HTTP 404:
  ```json
  {"error": "model 'wrong-model' is not loaded on this port"}
  ```
- If the request body has **no `"model"` field**, the request is forwarded unconditionally.

This check applies whether the instance is currently running or sleeping. For sleeping instances, a mismatched model name prevents the wake - no container is spawned.

### Wake on request

When an instance with idle timeout is sleeping and a request arrives:

1. If the request carries a `"model"` field that does not match >> HTTP 404, no wake
2. If the model matches (or no model field) >> a new container is spawned, request is held until healthy, then forwarded

## Download Settings

The UI provides download-related options under **Settings >> Download Settings**:

- **Auto-retry failed downloads** - automatically retries downloads that fail due to network errors or interruptions. Off by default.
- **Retry count per failed download** - how many times to retry before marking a download as permanently failed (default: 3, min: 1). Only active when auto-retry is enabled.

## Docker Image Management

**Settings >> Docker Images** lets you manage the llama.cpp server images used to spawn containers:

- **Pull image by name** - type any image name (e.g. `ghcr.io/ggml-org/llama.cpp:server-cuda`) and pull it directly without it needing to be in the tracked list first
- **Delete local image** - each tracked image has a delete button that removes it from Docker and from the tracked list. Disabled for the active `LLAMA_IMAGE`. Returns an error if Docker refuses (e.g. image in use by a running container)
- **Auto-update** - optionally pull the active image on a configurable interval

## Model Backup and Restore

**Settings >> App Settings** provides export and restore for model metadata and presets:

- **Download Stored Models JSON** - exports all scanned models with their preset configs to a timestamped JSON file. Use this to back up your configuration or migrate to a new host.
- **Restore from JSON** - upload a previously exported JSON. For each model in the file:
  - Already present on disk: preset is merged in (existing values are not overwritten)
  - Not present but has a HuggingFace source: download is queued immediately and preset is pre-populated at the expected path so it is ready when the file lands
  - Not present and no known source: reported as unrestorable

## Cleanup Settings

The UI provides automatic cleanup under **Settings >> Cleanup Settings**:

- **Auto-clean completed/failed downloads** - removes download records older than a configurable number of hours (default: 24). Only affects completed, failed, or cancelled downloads - active downloads are never touched.
- **Auto-clean stopped instances** - removes stopped instance records older than a configurable number of hours (default: 24). Only affects stopped instances - running instances are never removed.
- **Auto-remove stale instance records** - periodically checks all `starting`/`healthy`/`sleeping` instance records against their actual Docker container. Records whose backing container is no longer running are marked stopped. Configurable check interval (default: 5 minutes).

Cleanup runs periodically in the background. These settings only remove or update records in the UI/state - they do not delete model files.

## OpenWebUI Integration (llamaman proxy)

The llamaman proxy exposes an Ollama-compatible API on port **42069** (configurable). Point OpenWebUI at it:

```yaml
open-webui:
  environment:
    - OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://llamaman:42069
```

**How it works:**

1. OpenWebUI calls `/api/tags` -> LlamaMan returns all available GGUF models
2. User selects a model in OpenWebUI -> `/api/chat` request arrives
3. LlamaMan spawns a llama-server container (using saved preset or defaults)
4. Waits for healthy, then proxies the request with format translation
5. When `LLAMAMAN_MAX_MODELS` limit is reached, the least-recently-used **Ollama-managed** model is evicted. Admin UI launched models are never evicted by the Ollama API by default (see [Model eviction policy](#model-eviction-policy))

Supported Ollama endpoints: `/api/tags`, `/api/chat`, `/api/generate`, `/api/show`, `/api/version`, `/api/ps`

Also supports OpenAI-compatible endpoints with auto-start: `/v1/models`, `/v1/chat/completions`

### Model eviction policy

The `LLAMAMAN_MAX_MODELS` limit controls how many **chat** models the proxy will keep loaded simultaneously. When a new model is requested and the limit is reached, the least-recently-used (LRU) chat model is evicted to make room.

#### Priority rules

Admin UI launched models have ultimate priority. The two API surfaces have different eviction rights:

| Launcher | Eviction behaviour | Cannot evict |
|----------|--------------------|--------------|
| **Admin UI** | Evicts Ollama-managed models first (LRU), then admin UI models if needed | - |
| **Ollama API** (`/api/chat`, `/api/generate`) | Evicts Ollama-managed models (LRU) | Admin UI launched models (by default) |
| **OpenAI API** (`/v1/chat/completions`) | No eviction - starts model only if a slot is free | Everything |

If the cap is full, requests that cannot evict return HTTP 503:
```
model limit reached (LLAMAMAN_MAX_MODELS=N); admin-launched models cannot be evicted via the API
model limit reached (LLAMAMAN_MAX_MODELS=N); the OpenAI API does not evict running models
```

#### App Settings toggles

Two toggles in **Settings >> App Settings** control eviction behaviour:

- **Enforce `LLAMAMAN_MAX_MODELS` for admin UI launches** - when on, the admin UI silently evicts the LRU model (Ollama-managed first) before launching. When off (default), the UI prompts you to confirm before exceeding the cap.
- **Allow Ollama API to evict admin-launched models** - when on, the Ollama API can also evict admin UI launched models as a fallback if no Ollama-managed models are available to evict. Off by default. Has no effect on the OpenAI API, which never evicts.

#### Other details

- **All running instances count toward the limit** - both admin UI and proxy-managed instances. If you manually launch 2 models and `LLAMAMAN_MAX_MODELS=1`, the proxy sees you are already over the limit.
- **Embedding models are excluded.** Instances marked as **Embedding Model** do not count toward the limit and are never evicted. This lets you keep an embedding model loaded permanently alongside your chat models.
- **`LLAMAMAN_MAX_MODELS=0` (default) disables eviction entirely.** The proxy will launch models on demand without ever stopping existing ones.

## Storage Backends

### JSON (default)

Zero-config. Stores data in JSON files under `DATA_DIR` (`/data`):
- `state.json` - instances and downloads
- `presets.json` - per-model launch presets
- `users.json` - user accounts
- `settings.json` - global settings
- `api_keys.json` - API key hashes

Instance and download logs are written to `LOGS_DIR` (`/tmp/llama-logs`), which is separate from persistent data.

### MariaDB / MySQL

Create the database and a dedicated user:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE llamaman CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
CREATE USER 'llamaman'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'yourpassword';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON llamaman.* TO 'llamaman'@'%';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

Then set `DATABASE_URL` to enable:

```yaml
environment:
  - DATABASE_URL=mysql+pymysql://llamaman:yourpassword@host:3306/llamaman
```

Tables are auto-created on first connection. Requires `sqlalchemy` and `pymysql` (included in requirements).

|---|---|---|
| `LLAMA_IMAGE` | _(auto)_ | llama.cpp Docker image used for all spawned containers. Auto-selected from the detected GPU vendor if not set (`server-cuda` / `server-rocm` / `server-sycl` / `server`). Set explicitly to pin a specific image or version. |
| `LLAMA_NETWORK` | `llamaman-net` | Docker network that LlamaMan and all llama-server containers are attached to. Created automatically if it doesn't exist. |
| `LLAMA_CONTAINER_PREFIX` | `llamaman-` | Name prefix for spawned llama-server containers (e.g. `llamaman-abcd1234`). |
| `GPU_TYPE` | _(auto-detect)_ | Override GPU vendor detection: `cuda` (NVIDIA), `rocm` (AMD), `intel` (Intel Arc). Leave unset to let LlamaMan probe the host automatically. |

## REST API

All endpoints return and accept JSON.

**Authentication:** Management endpoints require either a session cookie (from browser login) or an `Authorization: Bearer <key>` header. When `require_auth` is enabled (default), model-serving endpoints also require a bearer token.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| Instance stuck on **starting** | Check logs via the Logs button. Common causes: OOM, model path typo, corrupt GGUF, image not pulled. |
| _"Docker image not found"_ | Pull the matching image: `docker pull ghcr.io/ggml-org/llama.cpp:server-cuda` (NVIDIA), `server-rocm` (AMD), `server-sycl` (Intel Arc), or `server` (CPU). |
| _"Docker API error"_ on launch | Ensure `/var/run/docker.sock` is mounted into the LlamaMan container (it is by default in `docker-compose.yml`). |
| No GPU / CUDA error | Ensure the NVIDIA Container Toolkit is installed and `docker run --gpus all` works on the host. |
| No GPU / ROCm error | Ensure `/dev/kfd` and `/dev/dri` exist on the host and your user is in the `video`/`render` groups. |
| No GPU / Intel Arc error | Ensure `/dev/dri` is accessible and your user is in the `video`/`render` groups. |
| GPU stats show unavailable | For NVIDIA: uncomment the `deploy.resources.reservations` block in `docker-compose.yml`. For AMD/Intel: ensure `/sys/class/drm:ro` is mounted (default in `docker-compose.yml`). |
| Wrong GPU vendor detected | Set `GPU_TYPE=cuda`, `GPU_TYPE=rocm`, or `GPU_TYPE=intel` in the environment to override auto-detection. |
| Port conflict | The form auto-suggests an unused port; adjust if needed. |
| Model not showing in OpenWebUI | Ensure `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` points to `http://llamaman:42069`. Check `/api/tags` returns models. |
| OpenWebUI gets 401 errors | `require_auth` is on (default). Create an API key in the UI and set `OPENAI_API_KEYS` in OpenWebUI's environment. |
| _"API key required"_ on all requests | Either create an API key, or turn off the "Require authentication" toggle in the API Keys section. |
| Containers not cleaned up after stop | LlamaMan stops and removes containers when instances are stopped. If containers are orphaned after a crash, run `docker ps --filter name=llamaman-` to find and remove them manually, or restart LlamaMan (orphan adoption runs on startup). |
