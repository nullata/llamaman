"""Versioned schema migrations.

Each migration mutates persistent state (SQL columns, on-disk file formats,
etc.) in an idempotent way and bumps the recorded schema_version when done.
Migrations run on every app startup; already-applied ones are skipped via
the version check inside an advisory lock.

To add a migration:
    1. Implement the work as a method on each storage backend.
    2. Add a wrapper here that dispatches to the active backend.
    3. Append it to MIGRATIONS keyed by its version number.
    4. Bump CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION.

Migration code never reverts. If you need to roll back, write migration N+1
that does the reversal.
